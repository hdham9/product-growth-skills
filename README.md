# Growth Skills

A public [Claude](https://claude.com) plugin marketplace of product-growth skills.

Currently includes two plugins, designed to work in sequence — diagnose where to focus, then design
what to test:

### `product-growth` — Product Growth Diagnosis

Helps a founder, PM, or growth person figure out **where to focus their product growth
efforts**. It runs a structured diagnosis:

1. Understands your product, business model, stage, and current metrics (conversationally —
   estimates with High/Medium/Low when you don't have hard numbers).
2. Builds a **driver tree** rooted at your objective (objective × business model), rendered as a
   color-coded Mermaid "growth map" with Leverage/Influence scores on each driver.
3. Scores candidate drivers on three lenses — **Leverage, Influence, and Compounding** — and ranks
   them into a shortlist with a clear **top 3**.
4. Hands back a markdown report and points you toward designing experiments for your top bet.

It ships with driver-tree templates for 9 business models: B2B SaaS, B2C subscription,
marketplace, e-commerce/DTC, fintech/transactional, ad-supported, social/UGC, usage-based, and
token-based AI products.

### `experiment-design` — Growth Experiment Design

Picks up where the diagnosis leaves off. Given a **focus area** (e.g. activation, retention,
free→paid), it:

1. Brainstorms candidate experiments through five lenses (mechanism, history, product, customer,
   market — including an optional scan for real-world examples from comparable products).
2. Scores them with **ICE** (Impact, Confidence, Ease) and shortlists.
3. Recommends a **top-3 portfolio** balanced across impact, learning, and speed.
4. Designs each one to a sufficient standard — hypothesis, primary metric, 1–3 intervention options,
   guardrails, risks, sample/duration, and **right-sized stats** (it flags when a powered A/B test
   doesn't fit your traffic and gives minimum-viable guidance instead).

It ships with two references: a playbook of common experiments by focus area, and a methods + stats
toolbox.

## Install

In Claude Code (or Cowork), add this marketplace and install the plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add hdham9/product-growth-skills
/plugin install product-growth@product-growth-skills
/plugin install experiment-design@product-growth-skills
```

Then just describe your situation — e.g. *"we've plateaued at 8k MAU and I don't know what to focus
on to grow"* — and the skill will run a diagnosis.

## What it does NOT do

It diagnoses *where* to focus. It deliberately stops before designing or running specific
experiments, setting up analytics/instrumentation, writing copy, or brainstorming channels — those
are separate jobs.
